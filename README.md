# Facenet
The TASS Movidius Inception V3 Classifier uses a pretrained or custom trained Inception V3 model and an IntelÂ® Movidius to carry out object and facial classification, both locally and on a live webcam stream. TASS Movidius uses the iotJumpWay for IoT communication and publishes messages to the broker when a face is identified.
